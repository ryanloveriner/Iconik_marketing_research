# Iconik_marketing_research

## Concept

This is a market research report I produced for Iconik Coffee Roasters in my capacity as Head Roaster and Data Analyst. Its purpose is to identify likely target states for an online advertising campaign.

Data was collected primarily through ChatGPT queries, which directed me towards surveys, web-scraping results, and publicly published reports from the POS systems company toast. It was compiled and cleaned in Microsoft Excel and exported as CSV files.

Visualizations were then produced with Python using matplotlib, pandas, numpy, and geopandas. The final report was compiled using Google slides before being presented to Iconik's production team and owner.
